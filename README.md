# DeepLearning-Project-2-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
In this project, we aim for developing a CNN model to perform the classification task of a composite [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AjW9I4YJKIwoqbkrkophr0E2O_8gDerj/view?usp=sharing) (combination of CIFAR-10 and MNIST).

This project was developed as part of CSE 849 (Deep Learning - Spring 25 Semester) at the Computer Science Department of Michigan State University, taught by Dr. Zijun Cui (@zijunjkl), with TA support from Gautam Sreekumar (@gautamsreekumar). Special thanks to them for their guidance and materials.
